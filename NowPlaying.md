No ETA on when we'll be back up, but i'm hoping soon.

If anyone would like to help localize this app for foreign languages, let me know.  Also, if you are interested in seeing this available outside the US and you are aware of a webservice that provides the appropriate theater/movie data for your country, i'd be happy to add support.  Just drop me a line.
