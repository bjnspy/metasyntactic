If government agents question you, it is important to understand your rights. You should be careful about what you say when approached by law enforcement officials. If you give answers, they can be used against you in a criminal, immigration, or civil case.

'Your Rights' provides effective and useful guidance in a user-friendly question and answer format. The application addresses what rights you have when you are stopped, questioned, arrested, or searched by law enforcement officers. This booklet is for citizens and non-citizens with extra information for non-citizens in a separate section.

'Your Rights' tells you about your basic rights. It is not a substitute for legal advice. You should contact an attorney if you have been arrested or believe that your rights have been violated.

The information presented have been obtained from the ACLU and also includes detailed information on the ACLU as well as numerous court cases that they have been involved with over the years.
